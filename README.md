# Sentiment Analysis Using Deep Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Learning project focused on sentiment analysis of tweets. The project utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning models to extract and analyze sentiments from textual data.

## Project Overview

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone behind a piece of text. This project uses a dataset of tweets to classify and extract sentiments using deep learning techniques.

### Features

- Preprocessing and visualization of text data.
- Implementation of deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, Conv1D).
- Training and evaluation of models for sentiment classification.
- Usage of modern libraries such as TensorFlow/Keras, pandas, and scikit-learn.

## Dataset

The project uses the **Tweet Sentiment Extraction** dataset:

- **Train Data**: Contains tweets with labeled sentiments (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Test Data**: Unlabeled tweets for evaluation.

Please ensure the dataset is located in the appropriate directory before running the code.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training.
- `data/`: Directory for training and testing datasets.
- `models/`: Saved models and checkpoints.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## Usage

1. **Preprocess the Data**: Run the preprocessing cells in the Jupyter notebook to clean and prepare the text data for analysis.
2. **Train the Model**: Train the deep learning model by executing the training section of the notebook.
3. **Evaluate Performance**: Use evaluation metrics like accuracy and F1-score to measure the model's performance.
4. **Visualize Results**: Generate word clouds and sentiment distributions for insights.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.0+
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- wordcloud

Install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Results

- **Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset.
- **Insights**: Key insights from the data visualization and model predictions.
